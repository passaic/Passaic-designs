Print.       Sandra Alfoldy has put together a volume that interrogates very contemporary concerns in craft practice. With a section on digital technology and craft, this book will be the most useful piece of craft theory as I begin my thesis research. Conversations about digital technology as a tool are mixed in with work of makers who use rapid prototyping in their work. Despite some reservations, Alfoldy says, “There is no doubt that the future belongs to the virtual spaces of craft (215).” I really enjoyed Love Jonsson’s essay Rethinking Dichotomies: Craft and Digital Technology (240) where a more dialectic approach is encouraged. The wide use of the internet to communicate about work and exhibitions is cited as a way that has changed the craft world (246). Craft practitioners can bring more warmth to technology, instead of technology making craft cold. Craft is being applied often as a methodology to other field rather than cozy objects (251).      Anisef, Jen. Tracing Emerging Modes of Practice: Craft Sector Review. Rep. Toronto: Ontario Craft Council, 2010. Print.      This document is important because it traces the way Ontarian crafts people are functioning and outlines trends in craft production. Also, Anisef was commissioned to do this report so the OCC could amend their funding structure, and as a forward-looking young practitioner I think it’s important to know what grant opportunities are out there. Anisef has a lot of important things to say about digital media in craft production and synthesizes arguments by Adamson, Shales and Nay among others. While we live in a global world, I think its important to decode what is happening locally as well, and this paper is a window into the recent work of the OCC.Burdick, John, and William Morris. William Morris: Redesigning the World. New York: New Line, 2006. Print.      An overview of Morris’ life and practice, this volume is instrumental in understanding how Morris fits into and shaped the Arts and Crafts movement. There are many images of his work, as well as interrogation into his methods for deriving these images. Also importantly, the book does not shy away from criticizing Morris’ oft-utopian ideologies and contextualizes him firmly in his time period. I am deeply inspired by Morris and his work and with more study of his practice I hope I can avoid his utopian trappings and create work that is more grounded.            Maybe deleteCarson, Kevin A. The Homebrew Industrial Revolution: A Low-overhead Manifesto. [S.l.]: urge, 2010. Print.       Homebrew Industrial Revolution is a dense book that I intend to work my way through in its entirety. It’s a well-researched volume discussing how our system has been heavily subsidized by the government to benefit major corporations. We are taught to take it at face value, but lean economics and local production are discussed as viable, valuable alternatives. From a theoretical standpoint I find this book saying things that I intuitively believed albeit in a strong academic voice with myriad references for support.       IMPROVEDoctorow, Cory. Makers. New York: Tor, 2010. Print.       Cory Doctorow’s Makers is a fictional synthesis of projects that utilize open source ideologies. The novel also functions as a thought experiment in new decentralized economics. While the methodologies ultimately fail in the narrative, “New Work”, a maker based economy functioning as a 21st century New Deal is a great lens to look at the future. Doctorow is a blogger on Boing Boing, a cyberpunk site gone mainstream, and a copyright activist extraordinaire. This book is interesting for its content and its methodologies; it is released on a creative commons license meaning it is free online for personal use.              Maybe replace with context!!!!Funderburgh, Dan. "DAN FUNDERBURGH." Dan Funderburgh. Web. 15 Mar. 2012. <http://www.danfunderburgh.com/>.       Dan Funderburgh has created the most impressive contemporary decorative arts that I have come across. Everything from bicycles to bongs manages to be entangled in vines and turned into beautiful pieces referencing Arts and Crafts patternmaking. I am particularly interested in his Tool Wall piece for its laser etched delicate patterns on objects revered for use rather than beauty. His website has a good gallery, which is inspiring in the variation of work he produces. If I could achieve such a successful update on traditional decorative arts with such a skillful balance of positive and negative space, I would be very happy indeed.Gershenfeld, Neil A. Fab: The Coming Revolution on Your Desktop--from Personal Computers to Personal Fabrication. New York: Basic, 2007. Print.       Neil Gershenfeld is a scientist from MIT on the forefront of personal fabrication. He heads MIT’s Centre for Bits and Atoms, which aims to combine the worlds of physical science with computer science. This book exists at the edge of the knowledge a lot of the time, but Gershenfeld’s work is really interesting. He has created “Fab Labs” all over the world with laser cutters, 3D printers, and other technologies. In developed countries these are used for more whimsical art and design, but in developing or isolated communities people create objects to test if milk is sour, track sheep and many more useful applications.       Find page referenceGlitschka, Von. Vector Basic Training: A Systematic Creative Process for Building Precision Vector Artwork. Berkeley, CA: New Riders, 2011. Print.       Basic Vector Training provides a solid framework for beginning my experiments into Adobe Illustrator. With a focus on sketching, iterating and finishing a drawing before the artwork is even scanned, this book really pushes vectors as a tool for perfecting drawings. While I still have a lot to learn in Illustrator, a lot of the basic functions feel demystified such as bezier curves. Von introduces what he calls his “clock work method” as a way of placing anchor points to produce pleasing lines. This is a very basic introduction, but that’s exactly what I need.       Maybe deleteKadushin, Ronen. "Kadushin." Kadushin. Web. 15 Mar. 2012. <http://www.ronen-kadushin.com/index.asp>.       Aesthetically, Ronan’s work does little for me, but I am interested in his open design philosophy. He works with the open source software model and applies it to objects using a creative commons license. On his website you can find a manifesto as well as PDFs to create some of his designs. His manifesto calls for no additional tooling after the CNC machine has cut out the product, but I do find this limiting. Further, if a consumer has access to a CNC machine, I imagine they can find access to more common tools, like a sewing machine. Add a couple manifesto quotesMcCullough, Malcolm. Abstracting Craft: The Practiced Digital Hand. Cambridge, MA: MIT, 1996. Print.       Published in 1996, this book seems to be the first academic foray into digital media and craft practice. It is extremely dense, defining tools, tool use and tool systems before entering into an argument for digital tools. The arguments are largely intellectual and philosophical, and could serve as a strong theoretical justification for the work I intend to embark on. I think the most important assertion is the fact that digitally produced crafts maintain a humane element, and are not necessarily as abstracted as we might think.        Find some choice pointsMellis, David A. "Case Studies in the Digital Fabrication of Open-Source Consumer Electronic Products." Thesis. Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2011. Web. <http://web.media.mit.edu/~mellis/mellis-thesis-screen.pdf>.       Mellis’ thesis paper from MIT’s High Low Tech lab may be the most important thing I have come across in my research. Mellis tries to rethink how we use and make objects with case studies around shared production of three consumer electronics. He is talking about the same digital circumvention of industrialization that I want to interrogate. “Both craft and digital fabrication blur [the distinction between design and production] by allowing for the gradual evolution of a design through the work of many people.” He focuses on the open source software model and applies it to physical objects.

Print.       Full of images from decorative arts traditions all over the world, this giant Taschen book is a fantastic reference for surface design inspiration. Every plate is documented by date, culture and includes a description of its implementation. Every image could be inspiration for a contemporary surface design pattern, there is truly a fount of material. Whenever I am feeling uninspired, or stuck on a formal consideration I flip through the pages and without fail I will have resolved my problem within a few hundred.Swoon. Swoon. New York: Abrams, 2010. Print.       For the past few years this book has been a fount of inspiration for me. Callie Curry is an artist who makes more than a pretty picture with work that is political, social and community based. The essays in this book provide a strong basis for understanding the myriad practices she has employed in the past decade. Both personal and academic, there are plenty of ideological places to jump off from. The work itself, while varied, shows a consistent commitment to draftsmanship and the use of decorative patterns. This work has been hugely inspirational to me, and I always keep Swoon in mind when creating.Thomas, Dana. Deluxe: How Luxury Lost Its Luster. New York: Penguin, 2008. Print.       The world of luxury brands has a hold on the public consciousness, and Deluxe attempts to break down the fetishization of these products by exposing their poor construction and lack of corporate integrity. This book serves as a tool in understanding how this hollowed out market functions. While only one symptom of larger, broken system, this interrogation into the luxury industry brings up questions about outsourcing, seasonality, and marketing. As crafts people, luxury products are our main competition and it is good to be able to craft a strong argument against them.Future FashionGifthttp://tmg-trackr.media.mit.edu:8020/SuperContainer/RawData/Papers/362-Future%20Craft%20How%20Digital/Published/PDF
